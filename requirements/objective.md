# Goal


## Back story of data
We have 3 csv files in `/data/processed/` directory. 
This represents the organic growth of sales data from 2018 to 2024
in nov 2024 there was a sudden shut-down of business due to policy changes, thus the sudden drop.

since Jan they have slowly started rebuilding the business.
 
This explains the break in the data. 

## Aim

I want you to process this data and and help me create a model ( deterministic/ non-deterministic) to predict the sales for the next 1-2 months.

Create an implementation plan based on the insights after you understand the data and can validated the model.

Also suggest what kind of algorithm you think is best for this problem.
